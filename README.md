# Just Another Text Editor Project

## A project to practice the use of IndexedDB and Workbox

The Project enabled me to use the browser DB IndexedDB, <br>
which is a light weight DB for smaller projects. <br>
Furthermore, in this project I used a "service worker", which enables the web page <br>
to run offline and still to function. The application can also be installed which makes it<br>
a full PWA (Progressive Web App).<br>
This project allowed me to understand the fundamentals of PWA's and also learn how to structure<br>
the project into "client" and "server".<br>

The installation steps are as follows:<br>
First get the app from my GitHub (link below).<br>
Then run `npm install` in the `dev` folder.<br>
After that run `npm build` in the `dev` folder as well. <br>
When the the application is built a `dist` folder appears.<br>
Run now the `npm start:dev` command and the application starts.<br>
The command line will tell you on which Port the `web-dev`server` runs.<br>
Open a browser and under `locahost:Port` your application runs.
